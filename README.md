# chupi
Ever wondered what to do with all those alcohol bottles?

`chupi` is a python backend API for a dummy catalog of drinks. The idea is to condense all the modern knowledge
I have acquired through the years, and reflect them on a single and tiny pet project.


## Service Interface

It (try to) supports all the modern type of APIs that are lying around, including:

| status | type | framework | url |
| ------ | ---- | --------- | --- |
|:heavy_check_mark:|Backend Rendered Templates|Django|https://www.djangoproject.com/
|:heavy_check_mark:|Rest|Django Rest Framework|https://www.django-rest-framework.org/
|:heavy_check_mark:|GraphQL|Graphene|https://graphene-python.org/
|:hourglass_flowing_sand:|gRPC|grpcio|https://grpc.io/docs/

## Infrastructure
Also, I want to cover all the technologies used on the service level in a `devops` basis.

From continuous integration to servers configuration and deployments, including:

| status | type | framework | url |
| ------ | ---- | --------- | --- |
|:hourglass_flowing_sand:|Service on the Cloud|AWS|https://aws.amazon.com/
|:heavy_check_mark:|Continous Integration Platform|Travis|https://travis-ci.org/
